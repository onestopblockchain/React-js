For running the React App on your system you have to install the Node js on your system.
You can download the node js installer from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
After installing the node in the node js terminal run this npm install -g create-react-app
After that download the folder from repo extract it in your system after that go to that folder using cd command and write "npm start" in the 
terminal

After starting the app you will see the widget settings there select and save your settings and refresh the page to see the results.
I used the local storage for saving the widget settings and on the bases of settings it will query the data from your provided json file.
